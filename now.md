### Work

Professionally working as a human evaluator and refiner of AI-generated code. I also hold the position of a Research Assistant at my university. Of the two, I'm more proud of the latter one.

In queue: Wool (The books behind the TV series 'Silo'.)

---

Currently watching: A Gentleman in Moscow (so far, so good). 

In queue: Dragon Ball Daima (anime), Senna. 

---

### Movies

Just watched: Mickey 17 (good stuff)

In queue: Anora, Enemy, Novocaine, and more. 

---

### Games

Playing Overwatch 2 nearly every night. 

As for offline games, really enjoying the Commandos: Origin. This one takes me back to chilhood.

---

### Sports

Obsessively following F1. A proud member of the Papaya Army.

### Life (in general)

Moving back and forth between two districts that have a ~five-hour journey in the middle. 

Trying to work out more. Excited for my first step into the world of running (7.5K in mid-May).

Just got my first citation, pretty stoked about that. Wrecking my brain about future research ideas. 

Have been thinking about starting a blog. Soon (maybe). 

Really enjoying building frontend web stuff lately. Will create a `/stuff` page and dump them there. 

Continuously tweaking this site.

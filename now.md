### Life (in general)

Moving back and forth between two districts that have a ~five-hour journey in the middle. 

Trying to work out more. Excited for my first step into the world of running (7.5K in mid-May).

Just got my first citation, pretty stoked about that. Wrecking my brain about future research ideas. 

Started a <a href="https://synapse-story.netlify.app" target="_blank">blog</a>. 

Really enjoying building frontend web stuff lately. Will create a `/stuff` page and dump them there. 

Continuously tweaking this site.

This image captures a moment from Hour of Code 2022, where I had the joy of teaching AI to a group of enthusiastic high school students. While I've led a few workshops before in my university, nothing compared to the excitement and energy of this session!

### Interests 

I unwind with a good book or immerse myself in fantastical worlds through movies, TV series, and open-world games. My taste in movies is eclectic, and I enjoy everything from gripping sci-fi to captivating historical drama. Whenever possible, I hit the road to explore new places and cultures. I occasionally write on [Medium](https://medium.com/@shafayet.rajit.101) about various concepts. Feel free to check out my [Letterboxd](https://letterboxd.com/shafayet_rajit/) and [Storygraph](https://app.thestorygraph.com/profile/shafayet_rajit) profile. Take a stroll through the world captured by [my lens](https://shafayetrajit.github.io/gallery/).

I graduated in Computer Science and Engineering from North South University, Bangladesh, and currently work as a Coding Artificial Intelligence Trainer at <a href="https://www.invisible.co/">Invisible Technologies Inc.</a> In my role, I work on improving how Large Language Models (LLM) understand and generate code-based instructions. This includes evaluating their performance on diverse tasks, identifying strengths and weaknesses, and contributing to benchmarks focused on accuracy, coherence, and execution.

<br />

My research interests lie at the intersection of AI and healthcare, focusing on innovative solutions to improve patient outcomes. Currently, I'm working on 2D image-based drug discovery method for Dengue treatment, using visual representations of molecular structures to accelerate the drug discovery process. Under the guidance of <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/tanzilctg/">Dr. Tanzilur Rahman</a>, this research aims to contribute to the global fight against Dengue.

<br />

In parallel, I am working under the supervision of <a href="https://ece.northsouth.edu/people/rashedur-rahman/">Dr. Mohammad Rashedur Rahman</a> on developing efficient techniques tailored for resource-constrained devices. This project focuses on optimizing advanced computational methods to ensure reliable performance within limited hardware environments, making them more accessible for practical, real-world use.
